Verb + preposition
Some verbs require a preposition as a helper after them.
However not all prepositions are valid and not all verbs require them.
eg: "sojourn" requires a preposition - "ants are sojourning the tree" is incorrect, needs a preposition of place or time


Nouns, personal pronouns and gender
A personal pronoun's gender must agree with its anticedent.
Nouns must define their gender.
eg: "the chapter invests his plumb skin" - is incorrect - "his" must be "its" if a personal pronoun is used


Add conjunctions
Categories into equal (and), subordinate, comparative, etc
Use to add another noun clause: NounClause, VerbClause, NounClause, Conjunction, NounClause
This allows for a cheap and quick increase in combinations
